# custom_i3
this project is my customized i3wm configuration files

there is two main config files

the first one that ou need to add is in i3 directory that you should add it in certain path and ts path is : "~/.config/i3/config"

at first you don't have "i3" directory and you should add it to add this file you can use "sudo vim ~/.config/i3/config" and press enter and you can paist "i3/config" file that i provided you iin this project

to add the second config file you should add another path in your ".confg/" path that is "~/.config/i3status/config"

to add it you can use "sudo vim ~/.config/i3status/config" and paist "i3status/config" that is proviided in project

after adding this two files you need to restart i3 service to restatrt it you can use "mod+shift+R"

and that's all you need to do I hope you enjoy it
